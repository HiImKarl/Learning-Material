A simple templated AVL tree implementation in C++. Nodes are not wrapped in a tree class, but an API is exposed that allows the nodes to be worked with directly.

There is no depedency to the standard library (except for in the test cases). 

Part1 contains an AVL tree with the data holder, two child variables, and a height variable. Part2 extends Part1 and adds a parent pointer and iterators.
